## Info

- **_Test.**
Usually class `xxx` is not runnable.
`xxx_Test` are given for you to run your code and check the results.
Debug your code step by step if you needed.

	*Feel free to modify them.* 

- **TestsShared.**
	jUnit tests `xxx_jUnit` in `test_shared` package are given for you to test your code.
Your code is expected to pass all the shared tests.

	*Do not change them.* 

- **TestsHidden.**
	AutoGrader uses hidden tests for grading. 
Hidden test are not shared with you.
	- Some of hidden test are like shared tests but with different data.
	
		Example: A shared test is `add(1, 2)` with result of 3.
	A similar hidden test would be `add(6, 9)` whose result is not 3 but 15.
	- Some of them are completely new and not like shared test.
Therefore, even if your code passes all the shared tests, it does not mean that it will pass the hidden tests.
